# PolicyWork
A repository containing a number of R and Python scripts I wrote while working in public policy.
I worked on projects in a wide range of policy areas including drug policy, healthcare, and education, and subsequently wrote a lot of R scripts for collecting, cleaning, and visualizing data. 
Unfortunately I was not able to take all of my work with me, and as such most scripts will not have a data file included.

- [Scraping teacher implementation strategies for education technology](https://github.com/MokeEire/PolicyWork/blob/main/Education/Implementation%20web%20scrape_02142017.R)
