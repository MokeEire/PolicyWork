# PolicyWork
I largely learned to program in R and Python as a research assistant for a think tank. 
I worked on projects in a wide range of policy areas including drug policy, healthcare, and education, and subsequently wrote a lot of R scripts for collecting, cleaning, and visualizing data. 
Unfortunately I was not able to take all of my work with me, and as such most scripts will not have a data file included.

A project description is included where possible.
