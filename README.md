# üìùPolicyWork 
This is a repository containing some of my data collection, processing, and visualization work for projects at a public policy research institution.
The files are organized by policy area, and in cases where I have multiple files, by project. 
Some of the work is quite old and definitely has some newbie errors throughout. Thankfully, I was surrounded by researchers and programmers who helped me grow and learn. 
Unfortunately I was not able to take all of my work with me for various reasons, and as such most scripts will not have a data file included.
